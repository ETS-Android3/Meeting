Meeting is an native Android mobile application to organize meetings events.

# REMARKS

* The API level 24 has been used.

# TIPS

* Use swipe from left to right gesture to come back to meeting list from a meeting detail page.

* Touch the underlined location in a meeting detail page to see the meeting location on a map.

* To add a meeting to Google Calendar, use "Add to Google Calendar" option in the overflow menu of a meeting detail page. This can also be performed by checking the checkbox while creating a meeting.

All other features have been designed such a way that they do not need any using instruction.

# EXTRA FEATURES

* Google Calendar event insertion makes it possible to add a meeting to a specified Google account calendar. The insertion is proposed to the user during the meeting creation, but it can also be triggered in a second time after this last one. The Google Calendar event insert is set to send a notification to the user 10 minutes before the meeting time.

* Meetings are classified in two lists: the upcoming meetings and the past meetings. Both meetings lists are ordered by date and the date is printed.

# CLASSES DESCRIPTION

The project is arranged in several packages:

* The "activities" package contains the applications activities:

  - AppCompatPreferenceActivity: An PreferenceActivity generated by Android Studio.

  - MainActivity: The launcher activity. It implements the meetings lists by means of ViewPager and TabLayout components.

  - MapActivity: An AppCompatActivity implementing OnMapReadyCallback interface to implement a Google Map feature. It uses the service Geocoder to find the postal address and coordinates provided by a meeting location string.

  - MeetingEditActivity: An AppCompatActivity implementing the page on which the
  user can edit a meeting entry. The layout uses a NestedScrollView
  (NestedScrollView is advised by Android documentation for vertical scrolling)
  which contains a Spinner component used to let the user selecting
  existing attendees to add to the meeting, and the hacked ListView component
  (cf. UnrolledListView in components package) to show the meeting attendees
  selected.

  - MeetingViewActivity: An AppCompatActivity using a ScrollView component to show meeting
  entry information. It uses a UnrolledListView to implement the attendees list.
  The location of the meeting can be displayed on a MapActivity activity by
  touching the location which is underlined.

  - SettingsActivity: An AppCompatPreferenceActivity implementing the settings menus.

* The "adapters" package contains the TabsPagerAdapter used by the meetings lists
tabs implemented in the MainActivity activity.

* The package "components" contains the UnrolledListView class which extends the
ListView object to hack the ListView component by overriding the onMeasure method.
This component makes it possible to use an unrolled ListView inside a SrollView.
The idea of this hack has been found on Stackoverflow (see link on the comment
in the class).

* The package "database" contains the classes related to the application database
used:

  - DBHelper which extends SQLiteOpenHelper is used to manage the database.

  - Meeting describe a row of the table Meeting.

  - Attendee describe a row of the table Attendee.

  - AttendTo describe a row of the association table AttendTo.
  This table is used to implement the multi-multi relation between
  The tables Meeting and Attendee.

* The package "fragments" contains the fragments:

  - MeetingFragment: The fragment used in the TabLayout in MainActivity to implement the meeting lists of the tabs. It uses a ListView component.

* The "repositories" packages contains the classes which manage the database table.

  - AttendeeRepo

  - AttendTorepo

  - MeetingRepo

* The "tasks" repository contains the tasks objects:

  - GoogleCalendarTask: An AsyncTask object which make use of the Google Calendar API to
  send insertion request to the Google Calendar of the Google account set in the
  application settings. If no account is specified, the task prompt the user to choose one.
